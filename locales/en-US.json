    "chef_about": "Jeffrey \"Jasco\" Tome's journey began in 2001 when he first set foot in the town of Popoyo, Nicaragua. Captured by the area's charm, its warm-hearted people, and the thrilling surfing and fishing opportunities, he quickly made it his second home. In 2003, Jeffrey embraced his passion for cooking by becoming the chef at Popoyo Surf Lodge, where he honed his skills and delighted guests with his culinary creations. A few years later, Jeffrey's culinary journey led him to Surfari Charters where he was brought on as Executive Chef at Rancho Santana. It was during his tenure at Rancho Santana that Jeffrey's love for fishing and surfing culminated in the creation of a custom panga boat for fishing and surfing charters in the area. With access to an array of fresh fish, Jeffrey began selling sushi from his home several days a week, marking the humble beginnings of what would later blossom into Jasco's Sushi Bar and Grill."
